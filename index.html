            <p id="bio">Hi, my name is Calista DeGuzman. I am 15 years 
              old (as of 2023) from Hockessin Delaware. I am 
              very spontaneous, passionate, independent, and 
              always seeking new adventures. I am naturally 
              a curious person and I enjoy going to school and 
              learning about new interesting topics. As an athlete, 
              I enjoy traveling around the world for my competitions. 
              A big goal of mine is to attend the University of 
              Pennsylvania, and when I grow up I aspire to become 
              a dermatologist.</p>

                <div id="mbtipara"><p>People with the ESTP personality type are vibrant individuals brimming with an enthusiastic and spontaneous energy. They tend to be on the competitive side, often assuming that a competitive mindset is a necessity in order to achieve success in life. With their driven, action-oriented attitudes, they rarely waste time thinking about the past. In fact, they excel at keeping their attention rooted in their present – so much so that they rarely find themselves fixated on the time throughout the day. </p></div>

    <h1 class="athletetitle">My Life as an Athlete</h1>
    <p class="tkd">I am a taekwondo athlete and currently ranked #1 in the nation. Taekwondo is the national sport of Korea and is a martial art that focuses on self-defense, discipline, and physical 
      fitness. It combines various kicks, punches, and blocks to develope strength, flexibility, and balence. As a taekwondo athlete on the USA National Team I travel all over the world to 
      various competitions (both domestic and international) and I can say that taekwondo has provided me with new opportunities to meet new people with diverse backgrounds, and 
      experience different perspectives of life, something that is beyond what you can
       experience in a classroom. One of my proudest moments in my career is winning gold at the 2022 World Championships in Korea. Sometimes my competitions overlap with school, so it is essential for me to maintain a good balence of academics and athletics. I am very 
      dedicated to my training and go up to New Jersey every weekend to train, and sometimes I even spend my winter breaks or spring breaks training. I spent a majority of my summer in Korea training and competing but aside from that it was a great opportunity to experience the culture of Korea and meet new people. Taekwondo keeps me active, and motivated to strive for new goals. I enjoy taekwondo and hope to 
      continue my career to the olympic games in 2028.</p>
