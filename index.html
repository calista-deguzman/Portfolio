            <p id="bio">Hi, my name is Calista DeGuzman. I am 15 years 
              old (as of 2023) from Hockessin Delaware. I am 
              very spontaneous, passionate, independent, and 
              always seeking new adventures. I am naturally 
              a curious person and I enjoy going to school and 
              learning about new interesting topics. As an athlete, 
              I enjoy traveling around the world for my competitions. 
              A big goal of mine is to attend the University of 
              Pennsylvania, and when I grow up I aspire to become 
              a dermatologist.</p>

                <div id="mbtipara"><p>People with the ESTP personality type are vibrant individuals brimming with an enthusiastic and spontaneous energy. They tend to be on the competitive side, often assuming that a competitive mindset is a necessity in order to achieve success in life. With their driven, action-oriented attitudes, they rarely waste time thinking about the past. In fact, they excel at keeping their attention rooted in their present â€“ so much so that they rarely find themselves fixated on the time throughout the day. </p></div>
